     <p> This is the best, easy tuna steak marinade! All you need is a few simple ingredients and 30 minutes to infuse  <br>
        your tuna steaks with deliciously bold flavor –zesty, with fresh herbs, garlic, a hint of sweet honey, and savory spices.<br>
        Tuna steak is one of my favorite fish to make. It’s so meaty and easy to cook and tastes delicious. This marinade for tuna steaks <br>
        couldn’t be any easier – it’s full of simple ingredients you probably already have (think oil, honey, garlic, cumin, parsley).
