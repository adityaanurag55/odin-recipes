   <p>An easy crab legs recipe with a garlicky butter sauce that's ready in just 20 minutes! <br>
    I ended up getting some snow crab legs on sale at the market. I wanted something a <br>
    little different from plain steamed, boiled, or grilled crab legs,so I ended up<br>
    throwing a few things together to make this awesome crab leg recipe.<br>+
    This dish would be great with shrimp as well.</p>

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>

    <ul>   
          
        <li> 3 ½ pounds Alaskan king crab legs with shell</li>
        <li> 6 ears fresh corn </li>
        <li> 1 ½ cups butter  </li>
        <li> 3 teaspoons minced garlic  </li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon Old Bay Seasoning TM, or to taste </li> 




    </ul>
    <br>

    <h2> Directions</h2>

    <ol>

        
         <li>In a very large stock pot, 
            bring a large amount of water to a boil. </li>
         <li>Place crab legs and corn in the pot of boiling water.</li>   
          <li>Boil until corn is tender and crab legs are opaque and flaky.</li> 
           <li> Crab may finish cooking before corn;</li>
            <li>check every 5 minutes to see if they are finished cooking.</li>   
          <li>   Drain well. Cut a slit into each crab leg shell to make it easier for your guests</li>

        <li>In a large saucepan, melt butter, garlic, red pepper flakes, and Old Bay seasoning. Stir in crab and corn and sauté for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
