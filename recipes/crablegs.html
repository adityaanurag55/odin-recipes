   <p>An easy crab legs recipe with a garlicky butter sauce that's ready in just 20 minutes! <br>
    I ended up getting some snow crab legs on sale at the market. I wanted something a <br>
    little different from plain steamed, boiled, or grilled crab legs,so I ended up<br>
    throwing a few things together to make this awesome crab leg recipe.<br>
    This dish would be great with shrimp as well.</p>
