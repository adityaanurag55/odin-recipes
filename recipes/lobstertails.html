 <p> lobster tail is a dish of lobster tails cooked on a grill and basted in a buttery herb sauce. <br>
     It's a BBQ-inspired dish that results in tender lobster meat with a smoky flavor. <br>
     Grilled lobster tails seasoned with lemon, olive oil, garlic, and paprika. <br>
     This recipe takes no time at all but the lobster is oh-so-tender and delicious!
